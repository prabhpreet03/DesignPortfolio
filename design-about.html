        <p class="about-us-description">
                Hello! I am Prabhpreet from Northern California. I have a Bachelors in Software Engineering and after few years of coding my life away, I decided to get in to what I really love; UX and UI Design. I have always admired doing design work since I was like ten years old. Whether it was creating logos or banners for events, I always enjoyed doing this. After my education and working in the coding world, it became more evident that I was meant for design!

                    <div class="team-member-description" style="width:30vw;">
                        Steve Jobs is one my biggest inspirations and motivations for the way he thought UI and UX to be. I believe that the only reason Apple was able to perform so well in the industry where everyone loved a Microsoft was the UI and UX.

                    <div class="team-member-description" style="width:30vw;">
                        Gary Simon runs a YouTube channel called DesignCourse. Throughout my design journey, I watched his videos to learn about design and technologies such as Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.

            <div class="gear-description about-us-description" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>
                        I am skilled in various softwares and toolsets. For UX and UI Design I am capable of doing work in Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch, etc. I have been using Adobe Photoshop and the creative cloud for the past ten years as well. 
                        I also run a succesful photography and video business that uses my skills from Adobe Premiere, Lightroom, Illustrator and Photoshop etc. 
                        Having a bachelors in Software Engineering, I am also aware of many technologies that go into building applications after the design process. I have previously worked in the UI and Front End Development phase as well. HTML, CSS, Javascript are also some of the coding languages I am very familiar with. 
                        Apart from my professional background, I love everything about the creation process. From research, planning, design and production: I admire the process of turning something to real life; whether it's woodworking or a website!
